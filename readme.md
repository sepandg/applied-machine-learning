# Applied Machine Learning
For this course my group was assigned to study the topic of Neural Networks and how to better implement them in creation of models. Our group wanted to study the concept of hyper parameter tuning and how we can leverage better tuning to increase our models accuracy.

The data set that we were working with is from Lending club which is a website specializing in giving loans to individuals. Our target variable which we wanted to predict was if the loan is defaulted or paid back in full. Since a small percentage of individuals default on their loan the data set in unbalanced, therefore we wanted to focus on how implementing weight parameter in our model can benefit our models accuracy.
